# About Me: A Code Craftsman Across Three Decades
Technical foundation began in 1993, with full-stack experience spanning two decades. I am a senior engineer and independent technical consultant (SOHO) who loves creating and pursues efficiency.

## Technical Core and Career Milestones
My programming journey began in 1993 in the 8086 PC/DOS environment, writing my first line of code in Basic. From early C, assembly, VB, PowerBuilder to today's cloud-native and AI applications, I have always been exploring the cutting edge of technology.

| Year | Milestone | Focus Technologies |
|------|-----------|-------------------|
| 1993 | Foundation: DOS environment programming | Basic, C, Assembly |
| 1997 | Professional: Full-time software development | C++, FoxPro, PowerBuilder, PHP, Python, Go, Javascript, Java, C# |
| 2000 | Transition: Independent technical consultant (SOHO) | Architecture design, project management, full-stack development |
| Present | Continuous innovation: Multi-domain cross-platform practice | AI, IoT, Blockchain, Web, Mobile |

## Project Experience:
Breadth and Depth Combined
I have the ability to transform abstract concepts into reliable, high-performance software systems, with project experience covering multiple high-complexity domains:

| Domain | Experience & Achievements |
|--------|--------------------------|
| Enterprise Architecture | Responsible for the design and implementation of ERP, CRM, and high-concurrency billing systems |
| Industry & Simulation | Participated in the development of railway/subway simulation systems and low-level drivers, ensuring real-time performance and stability |
| Emerging Tech | Independently completed blockchain applications, IoT solutions, and AI-related application development |
| Cross-Platform & Client | Rich experience in native App (iOS/Android), websites, games, and browser extension development |

## Technology Stack Overview
I can flexibly select and integrate multi-language, multi-platform technology stacks based on project requirements to build robust solutions.

| Type/Domain | Main Languages/Technologies | Platform/Environment |
|-------------|----------------------------|---------------------|
| Core Languages | C/C++, JavaScript/TypeScript, Java, Python, Go, C#, PHP, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis | Windows, macOS, Linux |
| Web / Frontend | Mainstream frameworks, browser extensions, websites, mobile (native and cross-platform) | Android, iOS |
| Legacy & Specialized | Delphi, PowerBuilder, Basic, PHP, Ruby | DOS, Windows 3.1, environment maintenance and migration |

## Remote Work and Collaboration Intentions
I firmly believe that high-quality code can be delivered remotely. As a SOHO professional, I enjoy coding, love life and travel, and maintain extremely high self-motivation to ensure project progress and quality.

| Professional Role | Collaboration Model | My Commitment |
|------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| Senior Engineer / Independent Technical Consultant | Accept long-term/short-term full-time or part-time remote technical collaboration | With rich experience and dedication to technology, ensuring your project receives the highest standard of professional support |
