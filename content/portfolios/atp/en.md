## Project Description

The ATP (Automatic Train Protection) subsystem is a safety control system that ensures train operating speed does not exceed the target speed. It is a subsystem of the ATC (Automatic Train Control) system and a key equipment for ensuring safe train operation and implementing overspeed protection.

This system fully simulates the ATP subsystem and the high-speed rail driving platform, and can also simulate various faults and abnormalities that may occur in the ATP system, used for ATP subsystem training, assessment, etc.

This system is developed using QT and C/C++, and can run on Windows, Mac OS, Linux and other platforms.

## Key Features

- Fully simulates ATP subsystem and high-speed rail driving interface
- Fully simulates train driving process
- Can simulate faults and abnormalities in various links
- All operation processes generate logs for assessment
- Customizable stations, routes, gradients, etc.
- Cross-platform support for Windows, Mac OS, Linux and other platforms
