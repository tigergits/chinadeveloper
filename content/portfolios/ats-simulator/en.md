## Project Description

A simulation software for metro train control systems. The control logic is developed using Python, the frontend uses React + TypeScript, and the management and analysis platform uses SpringBoot + Vue. The three subsystems communicate through MQTT message queues and support external physical devices such as control consoles. Supports simulation operations for tracks, switches, signals, platforms, etc. Can create trains, define various types of abnormal events, supports multi-user login, supports editing and loading test papers, supports binding console operations to control trains, and all operations are automatically recorded and analyzed to generate reports.
