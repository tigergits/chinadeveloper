## Project Description

The Smart Campus System is an integrated campus management and service platform built on modern information technology, aimed at improving campus management efficiency, optimizing teaching resource allocation, and promoting home-school collaboration. The system consists of a WEB management system, Home-School Communication APP (Mini Program), Faculty APP (Mini Program), Electronic Class Board, Smart Digital Display Screen, and other modules, covering campus management, teaching, student learning, home-school communication, and other aspects, with the goal of creating an intelligent and digital campus ecosystem.

## WEB Management System

- School Management (School Overview, News & Notices, Attendance Management, Leave Management, Payroll Management, Honor Upload, Electronic Class Board Management, Campus Monitoring)

- Basic Data (Student Management, Student Subject Selection Management, Student Class Walking Management, Student Honor Management, Teacher Management, Teacher Teaching Management, Administrative Class Management, Day Class Management, Interest Class Management, Department Management, Department Personnel Management, Classroom Management, Subject Management, Textbook Management)

- System Settings (Operator User Management, Role Definition, Vacation Arrangement, Semester Time Configuration, Percentage Indicator Definition, System Logs)

- Student System (My Semester Archive, My Learning, Live/Recorded Broadcast)

## Electronic Class Board

The Electronic Class Board subsystem aims to build an intelligent platform that integrates information display, class management, and cultural construction. This subsystem deploys electronic class boards on a class-by-class basis. Through the deployment of the electronic class board subsystem, it can effectively improve the level of campus informatization, optimize information dissemination efficiency, strengthen class management, enrich campus cultural construction, and provide convenient information service windows for teachers and students. This subsystem can interface with educational management systems, attendance systems, campus information release systems, etc., to achieve information sharing and linkage, and build a more complete smart campus ecosystem.

## Faculty APP (Mini Program)

The Faculty APP can view school news, view students' moral education assessments and percentage assessment records, view students' comprehensive quality archives, students' overall learning situation (including grades, classroom performance, student archives, etc.), view and approve student leave requests, manage student attendance types, watch live and on-demand videos, view and grade online homework submitted by students, view their own schedules and student ratings for each class, view their own pay stubs, etc.

## Home-School Communication APP (Mini Program)

The Home-School Communication APP can view school news and class dynamics, their child's moral education and comprehensive quality assessment records, student semester archives, schedules, grades and analysis, classroom feedback, live classroom for online learning, recorded classroom for on-demand learning, view and submit online homework assigned by teachers, view personal error books and knowledge point maps (to keep track of their mastery of various subjects and knowledge points), view their access records and consumption, and report lost access cards.

## Smart Digital Display Screen

The Smart Digital Display Screen system in the Smart Campus System construction plan aims to build a comprehensive platform that integrates information display, image promotion, cultural dissemination, and data analysis. The system uses high-definition large screens, through beautiful and elegant interfaces, combined with multimedia elements such as images, videos, and charts, to comprehensively and intuitively display the achievements of the school's smart campus construction and various information.
