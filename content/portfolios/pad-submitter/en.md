## Project Description

[DEPRECATED]

PAD (Portable Application Description) was a standard XML format widely used many years ago for defining shareware and freeware software information. Software authors could create a PAD file for their application according to this standard, then submit it to numerous software download websites that supported the PAD format. However, shareware as a distribution model has largely become obsolete. This software was developed in 2005 using Delphi 7 (Object Pascal) to help software developers automatically submit their software to over 200 such sites.

What's PAD file?

A PAD file (Portable Application Description) is a standardized XML file that contains structured information about a software application, acting as a digital "business card" for developers to list details like name, version, description, and download URLs, which download sites and directories automatically read and use to create listings, saving time and ensuring consistency. It's an open format from the Association of Shareware Professionals (ASP) used to automate software submission and updates across many platforms. 

PADSubmitter fully automates the process of submitting software PAD files to over 100 popular shareware and freeware sites. Simply enter a URL pointing to your PAD file and a category selection. The software promotion process is completely automatic.

To a shareware developer, it is well-known that a new software creation often takes much less time than its promotion. It is also known that a great part of the time spent on promotion is not always spent very effectively. But there are hundreds of shareware / freeware sites available and new ones popping up each week. A lot of time is usually spent on routine and mechanical form filling while submitting your software information to numerous software sites and archives.

## Key Features

- Manage multiple software's pad file
- Automatic submission to more than 200+ sites (see supported websites list)
- Easiness of use
