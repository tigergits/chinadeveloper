## Project Description

Railway computer interlocking network teaching system, supporting CASCO, Wuxi and other modes.

This system uses pure software technology to combine the computer interlocking upper computer operation platform, bottom interlocking logic and simulated field equipment status and change processes on one computer to form a student machine, realizing all functions of the computer interlocking system on one computer. At the same time, combined with the characteristics of teaching and training, a teacher machine is set up to record and replay student operation processes and set equipment faults and operating commands to assess students' ability to handle operations. Since there are currently multiple types of computer interlocking systems, this system provides versions of operating interface modes from three manufacturers: Jiao Tong University, Railway Academy of Sciences, and CRSC Design Institute, which can be selected for installation as needed, further enhancing the practical effectiveness of training.
