## Project Description

ServicesMon replaces dashboards with a single daily email. Instead of logging into multiple tools, you get one calm, decision-ready report covering domains, uptime, app stats, GitHub signals, and markets. No passwords, no APIs—only public signals. One setup, one email, once a day.

## What We Monitor For You

- Domain
Is your domain about to expire?

- Website
Is your website running normally? Is your SSL certificate about to expire?

- App
What's your app download count? What's your rating score?

- Browser Extension
What's your user count? What's your rating score?

- Market Data
Cryptocurrency, currency exchange rates, stock indices?

- Public Platforms
GitHub, GitLab, and other platforms. What's your follower count? What's your star count?

- Social Accounts
What's your YouTube account follower count? And more...
